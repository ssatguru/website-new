      <h4>about</h4>
      <img src="buddha.png" width="320px" class="w3-container" align="left" />
      Vishva (a Hindi word for "World") is a Virtual World Creator, modelled somewhat along the lines of <a href="http://secondlife.com/" target="_blank">Second Life</a> or <a href="http://opensimulator.org/" target="_blank">OpenSim</a>.
      These systems have, what one might call a "live" or "in world editor". Here, to edit, you do not enter an edit mode but, just like in real life, you basically move around the virtual world, as your avatar, modifying the world around
      you. This provides for a nice "What You See Is What You Get" experience and is one reason, amongst many others, why some are attracted to Second life or Opensim.
      <br />
      <br />
      Now Second Life and OpenSim are much more than just this live editor. They are big multiplayer systems with support for voice, chat, groups, inventories, content protection, economy, marketplace, currency, land system and on and on.
      <br />
      <br />
      In comparison the scope of Visha is very limited. It is a simple single player system. There are no server components and thus every thing runs inside your browser. Nothing is changed , updated or uploaded to any server. It is more
      like a set of simple, static html pages. You publish your World the way you might publish a bunch of static html pages. Just upload a bunch of files to your web site and your World is up and running. And just like html pages, wherein
      one can download a page or images from the page, make changes to them and upload them to your own site, Vishva can also, if the author enables sharing, make it very easy for others to copy/ download the World or any of its asset, make
      changes to them and upload them to their own site.
      <br />
      <br />
      Vishva is a TypeScript application built on top of <a href="http://www.babylonjs.com/" target="_blank">BabylonJS</a>, a great TypeScript/JavaScript, HTML5, Webgl based Gaming Engine.
      <br />
      Vishva UI is built using <a href="http://jqueryui.com/" target="_blank">JQuery UI</a>.
      <br />
      <br />Some discussions about this at the <a href="http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/21843-vishva/" target="_blank">Babylonjs forum</a>.

      <h4>features</h4>
      This is in an early alpha state. Lot of things are still in works.
      <br />
      <br />
      Briefly this is what we have now
      <ul>
        <li>on startup user is provided a basic scene with an Avatar, a flat Terrain, Sun, Shadows and a Skybox</li>
        <li>user can modify the environment - move the sun, change shades, add fog, change skybox</li>
        <li>user can add different kind of assets to the scene</li>
        <li>user can move, rotate, scale, clone, delete and download any of the assets added</li>
        <li>user can also add characters to the scene, check their animations, and use any of them as their avatar</li>
        <li>
          user can add behavior to the scene using a system called "Sensors and Actuators". <br />Briefly sensors are something you add to a mesh to sense something and send out a signal. <br />Actuators are something which you add to a
          mesh to make the mesh do something. <br />Actuators are "actuated" when they receive a signal from some sensor. <br />Currently we have four sensors - Click,Timer,Contact.Touch <br />and nine actuators - Animator, AvAnimator,
          Cloaker, Disabler, Enabler, Light, Mover, Rotator, Sound
        </li>

        <li>user can download the scene after having made changes to it and edit it later on</li>
        <li>user can start the world in non edit mode, which prevents other from modifying or downloading content from it</li>
      </ul>
